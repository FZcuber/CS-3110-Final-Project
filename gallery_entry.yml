  Our project is a interactive simulator for 2x2 and 3x3 Rubik's Cube. It supports all the movements
  of Rubik's Cube (R U L ...) and rotations (y, z, x). The cube can solve itself 
  if prompted. It has a 3D representation and a 2D representation. We also provide a 
  randomizer to scramble the cube if prompted and we have a counter to count how many moves
  you have made.
